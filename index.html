       <h1>Catonsville</h1>
        <p>Catonsville has been the home for numerous Black families both during and after the slavery years. At least one Black family functioned very well in <b>Catonsville</b> during slavery. That was the family of Remus Adams, a Black man who owned a blacksmith business at the intersection of Frederick Road and Bloomsbury Avenue. Catonsville Elementary School is located on the property previously owned by this Black man.</p>
        
        <h2>Grace A.M.E. Church</h2>
        <p>Grace A.M.E. Church was built in the mid-1800s and was the first Black place of religion on Winters Lane. It is also the 6th <i>oldest church</i> in Catonsville. There are at least nine other Black churches that religiously serve the community.</p>
    
        <h3>The community</h3>
        <p>The community had a school for Black children that was built shortly after the end of slavery. That building was torn down to the foundation and the Full Gospel Tabernacle Baptist Church was built on the foundation. In the very early days, the Black children were educated only to the 6th grade. Around the early part of the 1900s, a larger building was built for educating the Black youth (Banneker School, PS #21) that went through the 11th grade. In 1951, 12 full years of education was offered.</p>
